# Vision and Benefits

## Our vision

Modern data‑driven applications require a constellation of services: streaming
pipelines to ingest events, relational databases for transactional workloads,
search engines for fast retrieval, object stores for durable and inexpensive
storage, and compute clusters to process and transform data.  Today these
services are often provisioned manually or via ad‑hoc scripts that are tied
to a single cloud provider.

The **Data Platforms Engine (DPE)** aims to abstract away the low‑level
differences between cloud providers and present a simple, declarative way to
assemble complete data platforms.  Whether you are a startup experimenting
with a proof of concept or an enterprise building a production‑grade data
platform, DPE provides:

* **Consistent APIs across clouds:** The same YAML configuration drives
  deployments on AWS, GCP or Azure.  You choose the provider and DPE takes
  care of resource naming, API differences and sensible defaults.

* **Modular, pick‑and‑choose architecture:** Need only Kafka and object
  storage?  Disable the other components and let Terraform provision just
  what you need.  As your requirements evolve you can enable additional
  pieces without refactoring your infrastructure code.

* **Configurability without complexity:** DPE surfaces the most common
  configuration knobs (regions, network IDs, instance sizes, usernames,
  passwords) while hiding provider‑specific boilerplate.  You can override
  any variable by editing the generated `terraform.auto.tfvars.json` file
  or passing additional variables on the command line.

* **Pluggable configuration management:** Teams have different preferences
  for how software is installed and maintained.  DPE supports Ansible
  out of the box, provides simple Puppet manifests and includes shell
  scripts as a last resort.  You are free to swap in your own roles or
  modules.

* **Observability by default:** Instrumentation is not an afterthought.  The
  OpenTelemetry collector role is included to ensure that metrics and
  traces are captured from day one.  You can send this telemetry to
  Grafana, OpenSearch or Elasticsearch with minimal configuration.

## Benefits

* **Accelerated prototyping:** Get a Kafka cluster, PostgreSQL database,
  search service and Spark cluster running in minutes rather than days.

* **Reduced cloud lock‑in:** By providing a consistent interface over
  different providers, DPE makes it easier to migrate workloads or adopt
  a multi‑cloud strategy.

* **Infrastructure as code:** All infrastructure is defined in Terraform.
  Changes are version‑controlled, peer‑reviewed and repeatable.

* **Operational peace of mind:** Built‑in encryption, security group
  placeholders and automated configuration reduce the surface area for
  mistakes.  The observability stack helps you detect issues early and
  measure performance.

* **Community contributions:** DPE is open‑source and welcomes
  contributions.  As new services and best practices emerge, the
  community can add modules, roles and examples to keep the framework
  current.

The Data Platforms Engine is a living project.  Our vision is to make it
the easiest way to spin up reliable, secure data platforms on any cloud.
We look forward to your feedback and contributions!
